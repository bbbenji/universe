# Universe

## The Why
* To track my starred GitHub repositories and have them [crammed together on one page](#stars) :sparkles:

  This allows me to
    * quickly identify outdated repositories, like ["dead stars" (archived repositories)](#dead-stars) :skull::star:
    * browse through the [history of my stars](HISTORY.md) :scroll:
* Great opportunity to play around with Go, GitHub API (using [go-github](https://github.com/google/go-github)) and GitHub Actions :man_technologist:
